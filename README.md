# AIM:
To draw a UML diagram for a library management system.

# SRS (Procedure):
Actors Used-:
1. Librarian
2. Student
3. Staff
4. Admin
5. Software - StarUML

List of Diagrams -:
1. Class Diagram
2. Usecase Diagram
3. Package Diagram
4. Activity Diagram
5. Communication Diagram
6. Sequence Diagram

Procedure-:
Define System Requirements: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication and transaction processing.
Identify Key Actors and Use Cases: Determine actors and define their interactions.
Design the System Architecture: Break down the system into components
Create UML Diagrams: Develop use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams based on the system design.
Test and Validate: Perform testing to ensure the system meets functional requirements and security standards.
